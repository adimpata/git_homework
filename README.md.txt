In the Git + GitHub training, I learned to use the Git version control system to track and manage changes in test and development projects created in a company.I learned to add, commit, merge, and push code using Git and the GitHub platform for team collaboration. These skills are fundamental for developers and make work more efficient and easier collaboration in software projects.


Reflection
I encountered many errors that I solved and I managed to treat everything as a challenge
In the practical process I learned many things and deepened the concepts by dealing with errors and impediments
I am very satisfied with the training process and the materials provided, they are very structured and clear
